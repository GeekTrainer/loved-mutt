# Scenario : The Loved Mutt

According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), animal shelters receive about 3 million dogs annually - about 6 dogs per minute! While euthanasia rates have dropped, over 500,000 dogs are euthanized because they could not be matched with their original owners or an adoptive family.

Your team will aid a fictional adoption agency with deploying their website to the cloud. The application is designed to raise awareness of different dog breeds. A potential adopter can use the app to flip through pictures of various dogs and come up with potential names for each dog. This can be a great way to get a family excited about the possibility of adopting a new pet!

The agency has already created the website using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for the front end, [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) and a [MongoDB API database](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/current/) for the back-end. They have provided documentation your team can review to gain an understanding of how it works, and run it locally for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Each team member will need an Azure account. With [Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/a4s), you can access $100 in free credit, and a large suite of free services!

Your team should be familiar with the following:

- Git and GitHub
  - [Forking](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [cloning](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) repositories
  - [Creating and managing branches](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches)
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Each member of your team will also need the following software installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - [Install git on macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  - [Install git on Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  - [Install git on Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [Install Node.js on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)
  - [Install Node.js on Linux or MacOS](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## Resources

A series of resources will be provided to help your team determine the appropriate steps for completion. The resources provided should provide your team with enough information to achieve each goal. If you get stuck, you can always ask a mentor for additional help.

## Goals

Your team will obtain the starter, deploy the application to the cloud, enable authentication, and create and configure the database.

1. [Run the application locally](./goals/0-run-locally.md)
1. [Deploy to the cloud](./goals/1-deploy.md)
1. [Enable authentication](./goals/2-authentication.md)

## Where do we go from here?

This project is designed as a potential seed for future development. If you were to continue with this idea, your team could potentially:

- Use the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) to create an application to match potential adopters with dogs
- Use the [Bing Maps API](https://docs.microsoft.com/bingmaps/getting-started/) to search based on location
- Use [Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) to identify dog breeds
